  <div class="pop-tarts-prompt">
    <label class = "result"> Not a bad choice! In fact, you had the foresight to take it one step further and get the video sponsored by the creators of Pop Tarts. Your brilliance will be rewarded by a share of profits from this soon-to-be viral video. Congrats!! </label>
